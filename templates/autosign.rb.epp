# A note on logging:
#   This script's stderr and stdout are only shown at the DEBUG level
#   of the master's logs. This means you won't see the error messages
#   in puppetserver.log by default. All you'll see is the exit code.

# Exit Codes:
#   0 - A matching challengePassword was found.
#   1 - No challengePassword was found.
